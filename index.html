    <p id = "table-content1"><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
    My name is Ryan, 17 years old, started programming for <strong>3 months</strong>, You can click all of the socials that you talk to me. My dreams is to become a <strong>web developer</strong> 1 day and maybe i could start my own business. My hobbies are <strong>programming, web developing, playing chess and playing video games</strong>. I've always been passionate about modern technology and understand programming / web development. I am also still learning them and I will keep learning new things everyday and improve my mistakes!

    <p><strong>Where Am I now?</strong> <br>As you may know I also have a web development journey too! Well currently it's my first month learning web developement, currently  learning <strong>HTML / CSS course</strong> here at Khan Academy / Learning the basics of <strong>javascript</strong> at presence.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the future of my journey?</strong><br> Since I gain alot of interest in web development my future path is <strong>master the basics of web development</strong> and then maybe build simple website outside KA after I finish the course. After I master basics of JS I could do the
<strong>HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive.</strong> After maybe focus on a framework such as <strong>React.js, Vue.js, etc</strong>.<br>All of this is focusing on <strong>front end work</strong> and maybe next 1 or 2 year I could do <strong>backend work.</strong> </p>
